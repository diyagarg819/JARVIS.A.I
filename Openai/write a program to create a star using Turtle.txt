Cohere response for prompt: Jarvis using artificial intelligence write a program to create a star using Turtle 
 ********************************

 Certainly! Below is a Python program that uses the `turtle` module to draw a star. The program utilizes a simple algorithm to create a five-pointed star. You can run this code in any Python environment that supports the `turtle` graphics library.

```python
import turtle

# Set up the screen
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.bgcolor("black")

# Create a turtle object
star = turtle.Turtle()
star.speed(0)  # Set the fastest speed
star.color("gold")
star.width(2)

# Function to draw a star
def draw_star(size):
    for _ in range(5):
        star.forward(size)
        star.right(144)  # 144 degrees for a five-pointed star

# Draw the star
draw_star(100)

# Hide the turtle and display the result
star.hideturtle()
turtle.done()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Screen Setup**: The screen is set to a black background to make the gold star stand out.
2. **Turtle Object**: A turtle object named `star` is created. The speed is set to the fastest (`speed(0)`), and the color is set to gold with a line width of 2.
3. **Draw Star Function**: The `draw_star` function takes a `size` parameter, which determines the length of each point of the star. The loop runs 5 times, drawing each point of the star and turning 144 degrees after each line (since 360/5 = 72, but for a star, you turn 180 - 72 = 108, and then add 36 to get 144).
4. **Drawing the Star**: The `draw_star` function is called with a size of 100.
5. **Finalize**: The turtle is hidden, and `turtle.done()` keeps the window open until it is closed manually.

You can adjust the `size` parameter in the `draw_star` function to make the star larger or smaller. Enjoy your star! âœ¨
