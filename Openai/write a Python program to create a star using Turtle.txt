Cohere response for prompt: Jarvis using artificial intelligence write a Python program to create a star using Turtle 
 ********************************

 Certainly! Below is a Python program that uses the `turtle` module to draw a star. The program utilizes a simple algorithm to create a five-pointed star.

```python
import turtle

# Set up the screen
screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.bgcolor("black")

# Create a turtle object
star = turtle.Turtle()
star.speed(0)  # Set the drawing speed to the fastest
star.color("gold")
star.width(3)

# Function to draw a star
def draw_star(size):
    for _ in range(5):
        star.forward(size)
        star.right(144)  # 144 degrees for a five-pointed star

# Draw the star
draw_star(100)

# Hide the turtle and display the result
star.hideturtle()
turtle.done()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Screen Setup**: The screen is set to a black background to make the gold star stand out.
2. **Turtle Object**: A turtle object named `star` is created. The speed is set to `0` for the fastest drawing, and the color is set to gold with a line width of 3.
3. **Draw Star Function**: The `draw_star` function takes a `size` parameter, which determines the length of each point of the star. The turtle moves forward by `size` and then turns right by `144` degrees, repeating this process 5 times to complete the star.
4. **Drawing the Star**: The `draw_star` function is called with a size of `100` to draw a star with points of length 100.
5. **Finalize**: The turtle is hidden, and `turtle.done()` keeps the window open until it is closed manually.

To run this program, make sure you have Python installed and the `turtle` module is available (it comes standard with Python). Simply copy the code into a `.py` file and run it. Enjoy your star!
