Cohere response for prompt: Jarvis using artificial intelligence write a Python program to 
 ********************************

 Certainly! Below is a Python program that simulates a basic Jarvis-like assistant using artificial intelligence. This program uses the `speech_recognition` library to listen to voice commands and the `pyttsx3` library to speak responses. It also includes a simple command-handling system.

First, make sure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3
```

Hereâ€™s the Python code for a basic Jarvis assistant:

```python
import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import datetime
import webbrowser
import os

# Initialize the recognizer and the text-to-speech engine
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Function to speak text
def speak(text):
    engine.say(text)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Function to listen to commands
def listen():
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening...")
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
        try:
            print("Recognizing...")
            command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio).lower()
            print(f"You said: {command}")
            return command
        except sr.UnknownValueError:
            speak("Sorry, I did not understand that.")
            return None
        except sr.RequestError:
            speak("Sorry, my speech service is down.")
            return None

# Function to greet the user
def greet():
    hour = datetime.datetime.now().hour
    if 0 <= hour < 12:
        speak("Good morning!")
    elif 12 <= hour < 18:
        speak("Good afternoon!")
    else:
        speak("Good evening!")
    speak("I am Jarvis, your assistant. How can I help you today?")

# Function to handle commands
def handle_command(command):
    if 'time' in command:
        current_time = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%I:%M %p')
        speak(f"The current time is {current_time}")
    elif 'open youtube' in command:
        speak("Opening YouTube")
        webbrowser.open("https://www.youtube.com")
    elif 'open google' in command:
        speak("Opening Google")
        webbrowser.open("https://www.google.com")
    elif 'play music' in command:
        speak("Playing music")
        music_dir = "C:\\Your\\Music\\Directory"  # Replace with your music directory
        songs = os.listdir(music_dir)
        os.startfile(os.path.join(music_dir, songs[0]))
    elif 'exit' in command or 'quit' in command:
        speak("Goodbye!")
        exit()
    else:
        speak("I'm not sure how to handle that command.")

# Main function to run Jarvis
def main():
    greet()
    while True:
        command = listen()
        if command:
            handle_command(command)

# Run the Jarvis assistant
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Speech Recognition**: The `speech_recognition` library is used to capture and recognize speech from the microphone.
2. **Text-to-Speech**: The `pyttsx3` library is used to convert text to speech.
3. **Command Handling**: The `handle_command` function processes the recognized command and performs actions like telling the time, opening websites, or playing music.
4. **Greeting**: The `greet` function provides a personalized greeting based on the time of day.

### Customization:
- **Music Directory**: Replace `"C:\\Your\\Music\\Directory"` with the actual path to your music folder.
- **Additional Commands**: You can extend the `handle_command` function to include more commands and functionalities.

This is a basic implementation. For a more advanced Jarvis, you could integrate APIs for weather, news, or even control smart home devices.
